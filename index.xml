However, due to several data breaches that hit the headlines, more and more dev teams are now starting to incorporate security practices in their processes. Considering how agile methodologies benefit the development lifecycle, security should be approached in the same, or a similar, way.
Why Agile practices have been around for quite some time now and a lot of organisations incorporate Agile practices into their daily operations.</description></item><item><title>Agile practices for security teams</title><link>/outcomes/devsecops/working-sessions/agile-practices-for-security-teams/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/outcomes/devsecops/working-sessions/agile-practices-for-security-teams/</guid><description>Description of session The session considered how agile methodologies benefit the development lifecycle, and how security should and could be approached in the same, or a similar, way.

Why The Application Security Verification Standard is a list of application security requirements or tests that can be used by architects, developers, testers, security professionals, and even consumers to define what a secure application is.
ASVS has two main goals:
to help organizations develop and maintain secure applications to allow security service, security tools vendors, and consumers to align their requirements and offerings What Risk analysis is always subjective and this is why we expect that there will most likely never be a 100% agreement on this standard.</description></item><item><title>Arpit Agrawal</title><link>/participant/owasp/arpit-agrawal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/participant/owasp/arpit-agrawal/</guid><description>OWASP Juice Shop GSoC Student</description></item><item><title>Arriving at the Open Security Summit</title><link>/faq/arriving/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/faq/arriving/</guid><description>What should I do when I arrive at Center Parcs?

What is a Security Champion?
Security Champions are active members of a team that may help to make decisions about when to engage the Security Team Security Champions act as the &amp;ldquo;voice&amp;rdquo; of security for the given product or team Security Champions assist in the triage of security bugs for their team or area (see definition here)</description></item><item><title>Creating a Threat Library</title><link>/sessions-not-on-schedule/content_from_last_year/tm-threat-library/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions-not-on-schedule/content_from_last_year/tm-threat-library/</guid><description>WHY When creating a threat model there are a variation of thechniques that we use to define the threats.

Also, we need to run a local copy of the Summit site there (together with its ELK monitoring stack).
This setup should be reachable from the Venue network, and its initial purpose will be to have the Summit site and other test sites like [JuiceShop] 2.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Security Tools in the SDL</title><link>/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/integrating-security-tools-in-the-sdl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/integrating-security-tools-in-the-sdl/</guid><description>Most of today´s application security problems can be traced to flaws in the code. It does not matter whether security issues affect operating system components, client applications, web applications, or other systems, most well-known vulnerabilities are caused by coding errors and implementation issues.
The question here is why so many bugs and coding errors continue to cause major security issues when we have had years to deal with these and other common vulnerabilities that are still found in applications today.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Cynefin Framework</title><link>/outcomes/misc/introduction-to-cynefin-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/outcomes/misc/introduction-to-cynefin-framework/</guid><description>What is the Cynefin Framework?

For a relatively fast, dense, noisy introduction, please see https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/watch?v=516Z420BgkE from OWASP BeNeLux 2018.
It can seem that the cyber security industry has evolved ways of working, and preferences in solutions and methods, as a series of point solutions that have become accepted traditions / rituals, rather than as a collective effort at forward thinking. A vendor-led industry mainly driven by technical experts may have come up with the best overall strategies to solve the incredibly complex problems of cyber security, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel that way.</description></item><item><title>Lightweight privacy threat modeling using LINDDUN</title><link>/tracks/threat-modelling/working-sessions/tm-lindunn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracks/threat-modelling/working-sessions/tm-lindunn/</guid><description>Why Privacy by design is important; it is even required by EU data protection legislation. It however goes beyond the quick fixes that are typically associated with it (e.g. consent for newsletters) and requires a thorough analysis upfront of potential privacy issues in the system. LINDDUN privacy threat modeling can aid the analyst in this process to systematically elicit and mitigate privacy threats in software architectures.

In the previous sessions Kim explained the research that was performed at the University of Leuven.

This session is twofold. Firstly, it highlights the differences between privacy and security threat modeling, introducing privacy properties and providing an overview of the LINDDUN threat modeling framework. Secondly, it dives into the ongoing LINDDUN privacy threat modeling research, including the lightweight application of LINDDUN.
Outcomes/Deliverables The following are outcomes requested from the LINDDUN research team based on questions posed to the group on what they would want to see: Some specific (as opposed to abstract) examples have been requested from the TM project group to the LINDDUN researchers (Kim), and these will be presented in the LINDDUN research docs Low expertise / lightweight methodology examples requested The LINDDUN project looks to support multiple &amp;lsquo;extraction&amp;rsquo; types, please reach out to the LINDUNN team to discuss your preferred &amp;lsquo;extraction&amp;rsquo; type.</description></item><item><title>Louise Bayliss</title><link>/participant/louise-bayliss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/participant/louise-bayliss/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Luis Saiz</title><link>/participant/luis-saiz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/participant/luis-saiz/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Luis Servin</title><link>/participant-remote/luis-servin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/participant-remote/luis-servin/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Maeve Scarry</title><link>/participant/photobox-gs/week-ticket/maeve-scarry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/participant/photobox-gs/week-ticket/maeve-scarry/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Making Online Gaming Safer for Children</title><link>/sessions-not-on-schedule/children-game-safety/keynote/online-game-safety-keynote/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions-not-on-schedule/children-game-safety/keynote/online-game-safety-keynote/</guid><description>Setting the scene and direction on how to make Online Gaming Safer for Children (and how the community can help) MLi Group Chairman Khaled Fattal to deliver the keynote address and throw the gauntlet to challenge the Open security summit techie army to come up with a solution that will help make online game playing safer, especially for children.

companies should share information, knowledge, and resources so that malicious activities are easily detected and mitigated.</description></item><item><title>OWASP community-docs</title><link>/tracks/misc/community-docs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracks/misc/community-docs/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ll work on creating new content for the repo https://github.com/OWASP/community-docs.

Secrets are being used everywhere nowadays with the DevOps movement. API keys, database credentials, IAM permissions, SSH keys, certificates, etc. Many organizations have them hard coded in source code, littered throughout configuration files and configuration management tools, and stored in plaintext in version control.
There is a big need in the centralizations of secrets to improve the security posture and preventing secrets from leaking and compromizing the organization.</description></item><item><title>Securing Kubernete's hosted APIs</title><link>/tracks/misc/securing-kubernetes-hosted-apis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracks/misc/securing-kubernetes-hosted-apis/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Securing Serverless applications</title><link>/sessions-not-on-schedule/serverless/securing-serverless-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sessions-not-on-schedule/serverless/securing-serverless-applications/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Securing the CI Pipeline</title><link>/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/securing-the-ci-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/securing-the-ci-pipeline/</guid><description>Why This Working Session will consider the securing of the CI Pipeline - A key element of DevOps.
Doing CI builds, testing, and deployments have many advantages when done correctly. Using libraries from 3rd parties in your build can be on compromised servers. Even signing your packages or artifacts automatically could result in you delivering compromised software to others.
What Identify best practice for DevOps and Developers Agree what to include in a cheat sheet for developers who use third party services Agree recommendations for 3rd party service providers (for example, provide warning messages of possible insecurities) Outcomes This Working Session will publish:</description></item><item><title>Security Challenges - An Introduction</title><link>/outcomes/strategic-challenges/working-sessions/security-challenges-an-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/outcomes/strategic-challenges/working-sessions/security-challenges-an-introduction/</guid><description>Outcomes/Deliverables The outcome was a list of characteristics that describe the cyber security industry and the problems within it. This was sourced from everyone in attendance.
Synopsis and Takeaways The list of characteristics is below:

WHY Considering how intelligent security practioners are, how well funded they are, and how hard they work, it feels as though the industry should be obtaining better results than it is currently receiving.
Therefore there must be something systematically wrong with the way that cyber security is being run, and must be a way to achieve better results with the same resources.</description></item><item><title>Security Challenges - Analyse others</title><link>/tracks/misc/security-challenges-others/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracks/misc/security-challenges-others/</guid><description>Wednesday is a busy day for the summit, and some participants may have commitments elsewhere, such as at InfoSec Europe and BSides London. Therefore, wherever you are today, spend your time looking at what strategies and assumptons are already in use:

The organiser picked nine of the characteristics to concentrate on for this session.

Is the approach of finding similar industries or situations valid? Does Dave Snowden’s experience support following or abandoning this methodology? If it’s not valid, what methodologies should be used to create or find, and test, the correct strategies? Can we learn from other practitioners in related areas as a useable “hack” to choose effective new strategies rapidly?

This can include common economic patterns or competitor actions. Understanding climatic patterns are important when anticipating change. Doctrine are the basic universal principles that are applicable to all industries regardless of the landscape and its context. This doesn’t mean that the doctrine is right but instead that it appears to be consistently useful for the time being. There will always exist better doctrine in the future.</description></item><item><title>Wardley Mapping - Coordinating functions within a PST organisation</title><link>/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/coordinating-functions-within-a-pst-organisation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/coordinating-functions-within-a-pst-organisation/</guid><description>Most organisations have structures in place that can be used to embed mapping whether it’s an architectural group or an office of the CEO or a business relationship function or some other home. The role of the co-ordination function is to encourage compliance to policy (doctrine) often via a spend control mechanism and to enable sharing between the business units through the use of maps. This doesn’t require some big bang overhaul but usually the formalisation of an existing structure e.</description></item><item><title>Wardley maps</title><link>/tracks/keynotes/kn-simon-wardley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracks/keynotes/kn-simon-wardley/</guid><description>Simon presenting Wardley maps, and the use of topographical intelligence in business strategy</description></item><item><title>Wardley Maps for Security</title><link>/outcomes/wardley-mapping/working-sessions/wardley-maps-for-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/outcomes/wardley-mapping/working-sessions/wardley-maps-for-security/</guid><description>Description of session This practical session on creating Wardley maps considered the following aspects of Wardley maps:
