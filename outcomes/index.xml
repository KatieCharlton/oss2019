      <description>What is the Cynefin Framework? (after Wikipedia)   The Cynefin framework is a conceptual framework used to aid decision-making.
  Developed in 1999 by Dave Snowden when he worked for IBM Global Services, it has been described as a &amp;ldquo;sense-making device&amp;rdquo;.
  Cynefin is a Welsh word for habitat.
  Cynefin offers five decision-making contexts or &amp;ldquo;domains&amp;rdquo;
 Obvious (&amp;lsquo;Simple&amp;rsquo; until 2014) Complicated Complex Chaotic Disorder    These help managers identify situations and make sense of their own and other people&#39;s behaviour.</description>

      <description>Description of session The Tuesday episode of the Hack‚Äôn‚ÄôCode evening session series brought several more repaired e2e tests, significant progress on the Hacking Instructor and the GSoC project scope, more consequent spoiler protection and prettier Google search results!
Outcomes/Deliverables  The Hacking Instructor (https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/issues/440) was extended and brought closer to production-readiness Work on the GSoC &amp;ldquo;Feature Pack&amp;rdquo; project continued, focusing on getting currently open PRs (purchase limits &amp;amp; accounting user role) merge-ready In future the Juice Shop favicon should be shown in Google search results instead of the Angular default icon The infobox spoiling the Gitter &amp;amp; GitHub links to the project will now be hidden based on a configuration property Several e2e and unit tests were repaired and re-enabled, which will benefit the upcoming face-lifting merge  Follow up  Peer review the Hacking Instructor and its elegant new way of writing tutorial scripts in Typescript Merge the open GSoC PRs and continue with the delivery address feature Getting rid of the last remaining &amp;ldquo;xit&amp;rdquo; (=disabled) tests Anything new and fancy that you come up with  </description>

      <description>Description of session Session on Privacy threat modelling using the LINDDUN framework with Kim Wuyts. This session is twofold. Firstly, it highlights the differences between privacy and security threat modeling, introducing privacy properties and providing an overview of the LINDDUN threat modeling framework. Secondly, it dives into the ongoing LINDDUN privacy threat modeling research, including the lightweight application of LINDDUN.
Outcomes/Deliverables  The following are outcomes requested from the LINDDUN research team based on questions posed to the group on what they would want to see:  Some specific (as opposed to abstract) examples have been requested from the TM project group to the LINDDUN researchers (Kim), and these will be presented in the LINDDUN research docs Low expertise / lightweight methodology examples requested   The LINDDUN project looks to support multiple &amp;lsquo;extraction&amp;rsquo; types, please reach out to the LINDUNN team to discuss your preferred &amp;lsquo;extraction&amp;rsquo; type.</description>

Notes from the working session The following are notes from the session - at this stage nothing was decided, rather a set of requirements were gathered to help aid and direct future conversations/ work in this space.
Topics discussed
  Should we measure &amp;ldquo;ownership&amp;rdquo; for the activities, practices? (RACI ?)
  How about applicability (not all practices / activities are applicable)</description>

      <description>Description of session Using the outcomes from Monday&#39;s session, the participants identified some professions or situations that will be useful to steal/borrow ideas from on how to solve our existing challenges.
The organiser picked nine of the characteristics to concentrate on for this session.
 Asymmetric between us and adversary Auto-didacts - self-taught Blame culture Constant Evolution (speed) Eternal, the game doesn&#39;t end Expert driven, technical experts Imposter syndrome Lack of comparative data to judge who is winning or losing Optimisation Game  Outcomes/Deliverables Over the course of an hour, the following professions were cited as worthy of further investigation because they matched at least one of the characteristics cited.</description>

      <description>The questions for the session were as follows:
 Is the approach of finding similar industries or situations valid? Does Dave Snowden‚Äôs experience support following or abandoning this methodology? If it‚Äôs not valid, what methodologies should be used to create or find, and test, the correct strategies? Can we learn from other practitioners in related areas as a useable ‚Äúhack‚Äù to choose effective new strategies rapidly? What are the underlying assumptions of the current strategies?</description>

      <description>Reminder Threat Modeling: The sooner the better, never too late.
We all have different understanding of threat models, different use cases and different customers. Different != wrong.
Description of session Discussion on:
 What is the current state of threat modeling? Are there any new and exciting things happening? What is needed for the future?  Discussion Question to start conversation:
  Since Adam&#39;s book has there been any tools released that truly aid in threat modeling?</description>

      <description>Description of session The session objective was to discuss and answer the questions below.
   Question Parameters     1. How do we measure the maturity of a threat model? Data is stored &amp;amp; linkable (higher maturity) Formalisation (higher maturity) Process integration How is the model created? different levels of maturity Repeatability of the process Level of TM depth + classification of systems Re-usable components Maturity / knowledge / experience of the threat modeler + audience How much does the TM relate to the actual application (quality degradation over time) / synced versioning Relation / causation between requirements and the resulting TM   2.</description>

      <description>Description of session The purpose of this session was to discuss requirements around a data schema for threat modelling to enable and/or support repeatable and automated threat modelling.
Outcomes/Deliverables The conversation started with a walkthrough of the way Photobox are using vulnerability and risk data within JIRA to create graphs. This was done to show the potential of being able to harness usable threat data within a database to automatically create visual representations of the threat landscape for an IT asset.</description>

      <description>Description of session The purpose of this session is to introduce the project and create a rough roadmap of deliverables for the project during the summit. The project is currently a documentation project, but it lacks documentation; one of the key objectives of the week will be to produce documentation.

      <description>Description of session We want to create a model of a threat model. It needs to be generic so it fits all threat modeling methodologies. Later we can try to use this model to create graph based websites detailing the different techniques and methodologies as well as linking the examples we will have to these different elements of a threat model.
Creating a reference diagram that allows someone to be able to use it to help understand models.</description>
