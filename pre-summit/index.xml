      <description>If you&#39;re free on the 21st May, 6-8pm, we would love to have you along to an Open Security Summit Working Session revolving around Jira schemas.
The objective of the working group is to discuss the ways different organisations use Jira schemas to map the Security landscape.
We&#39;re running this session because it would be a useful exercise to understand what the variances between different schemas are and why, and to provide an opporuntity to work together to determine what the optimum Jira schema could be.</description>
