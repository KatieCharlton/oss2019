"content_plain" : "Wednesday is a busy day for the summit, and some participants may have commitments elsewhere, such as at InfoSec Europe and BSides London. Therefore, wherever you are today, spend your time looking at what strategies and assumptons are already in use:\nWHY By looking at the challenges we face abstractly, away from the day to day docket of tasks that must simply be dealt with as quickly as possible, we can find better ways of preventing fires rather than always putting them out.\nExamples The track organiser\u0026rsquo;s examples of the understated assumptions and strategies already in play:\n Bug bounty companies: that sufficient coverage of security vulnerabilities exploited by teams of motivated attackers can be achieved using a horde of enthusiasts working largely without co-ordination. Conference organisers and training vendors: that individual technical excellence is the most important factor when determining the success or failure of a cyber security endeavour, such as attacking or defending an organisation. DevSecOps: that sufficient staff can be found to cover the combined intellectual requirements of at least three traditionally distinct disciplines. Firewall vendors: that is possible, and optimal, to prevent most compromises before they achieve any intrusion on to any part of an estate rather than using initial intrusions as high fidelity information on attacks. Penetration testing: that it is possible to find a sufficient number of issues with a system by looking at externally, that an adversarial mindset is best employed in relatively small and time-boxed activities. Threat Intelligence: that attackers change their methods so infrequently that IOCs are of value.

(later may be expanded in other compliance areas too) This should perform the evaluation, follow-up assessments annually (or at major changes like M\u0026amp;As), tracking for resoltuions of the findings.. Things to consider: Are we assessing the corporate controls of the vendor or their solution\u0026rsquo;s security, or both? What framework or frameworks best suited for this? MITRE, NIST, ISO?? Scores on maturity, flags on category of information classification that is recommended to be shared with the vendor (i.e. do not share non-public information with this vendor until they remediate findigns A, B, C) Funding for the activites - should we form a consortium like what FS-ISAC does for threat intelligence? If the third party is critical outsourcing partner, would the standard evaluation be sufficient, or should there be additional things to consider.\nOutcomes Hard to tell, this session will be a good start on shaping the future of this activity.\nWho In last ten years, every job I had included third party assurance work and I kept sending similar questionnaires to same vendors over and over.

This track is focusing mainly on the following two documents that were created as part of the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) project:\n The Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) establishes a framework of security requirements needed to design, develop and test secure mobile apps on iOS and Android. The Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is a comprehensive manual for mobile app security testing and reverse engineering. It describes technical processes for verifying the controls listed in the MASVS. Slack Please also join our slack channel (especially if you are a remote participant):\n Register an account on the Open Security Summit Slack Join our Slack Channel Why We, the OWASP Mobile Security team, love the OWASP Summit. That time of the year when we come together, all in one place, and forget about the rest of the world (literally as we\u0026rsquo;re in the middle of a forest). Forget about companies / business and concentrate on making the mobile security world a better place. To achieve this we tirelessly work on the MSTG to make it even more awesome as it is already.\nWhat Imagine being in the same room as these people who share your same passion:\n the main authors of the MSTG and MASVS security engineers experienced pentesters researchers \u0026hellip; All working together on mobile security topics:\n creating new content for the MSTG researching together on the latest cutting-edge iOS and Android security topics learning and sharing knowledge with other experts and beginners Our working sessions are ticket based, just take the one you like or you\u0026rsquo;ll get one assigned depending on your level of expertise. We want to start the summit with a focus on the following milestones:\n MASVS milestone 1.1.4: MSTG milestone 1.2: Once you start you\u0026rsquo;ll not only have the chance to do a great contribution but also to drive interesting discussions with the rest of the participants.\nThis year we want to focus on the values that made the first summit a great oppertunity: learning through contributing!\nEveryone is welcome! If you\u0026rsquo;re already experienced you\u0026rsquo;re probably familiar with the issue that you cannot find any trainings/events on mobile security advanced topics that matches your level. Here you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to work hand in hand with people sharing your passion, interest and close to your experience level. One can always learn so much from doing research and being guided by other people (experts or not). If you enjoy sharing your knowledge you\u0026rsquo;ll have the chance to do so at the best working atmosphere. If you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner this is THE PLACE to start!\nCannot come over? Join us remotely! You may want to attend the presentations about onboarding or a 101. Otherwise: contact us, grab a ticket, enjoy the ride! We would love to guide you in your contribution and will take on PRs from morning till early evening (21:00).\nCheck the scheduled sessions below.\n",

Have newer detection mechanisms in the crackmes, for instance: make sure we have a crackme that effectively refuses to run on a rooted Android device (e.g. running Magisk)? Or make the app Frida-resilient. Or\u0026hellip; whatever you like! Try to make cool challenging apps for other people. Just make sure it can be built and tested by the pipeline mentioned in 2.

"content_plain" : "Mobile Basic Security Testing and Reverse Engineering Welcome to the ultimate OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide content reshuffle session!\nWhy If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with mobile security testing you\u0026rsquo;ll probably know that the way we perform the testing on the different platforms is completely different but at the end, what we want to achieve is the same. We want to get this reflected in the guide. We will be working on topics from basic to advanced Mobile App Security Testing, Reverse Engineering and Tampering on Android and iOS.\nAs a result, the current content will be restructured, which will help\n achieving a more organized testing approach and methodology. detecting potential missing tools or techniques. fixing missing links across chapters. Android and iOS chapter will mirror each other, so the next time someone (e.g. a beginner) wants to get started on these topics it will be very clear what has to be done and how. If you\u0026rsquo;re already an expert on e.g. Android, this will help you quickly identify the things you need when starting testing on iOS, e.g. \u0026ldquo;Accessing the Device Shell\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat Join us in a 2-day sprint to restructure the basic-testing and reverse-engineering chapters in a way that they are easily mappable. We want to be able to restructure the MSTG and connect it to the MASVS in a better way during the first 2 days in order to make the chapters more accessible.\nThis session focus on the following topics (and their corresponding chapters from the MSTG):\n Android and iOS Basic Security Testing (0x5b/0x6b) Android and iOS Reverse Engineering and Tampering (0x5c/0x6c) After the first restructuring and updated outline, you\u0026rsquo;ll have the chance to get your hands dirty and craft examples and new content for the MSTG to add next to existing tooling. For the new examples we will be introducing new tools like r2frida. Did you know you can reverse engineer an app straight from the process memory? That means, e.g. for iOS that you may skip the decryption and extraction of the binary.\nThe tickets for this working session will cover these topics and contribute to the restructuring of the MSTG as described in this issue. This should simplify the chapters, improve their readability and make the project a lot easier to maintain!\nWho The target audience for this Working Session is:\n iOS developers Android developers Penetration Testers Security engineers From experts to beginners. Anybody who is passionate about app mobile security, haves fun hacking, securing and/or developing mobile apps and loves to continuously learn and enjoys sharing knowledge.\nWhat do you need to bring with you? Minimum required: a laptop :)\nDepending on the tasks/challenges you choose:\n General rewriting tasks do not require any devices, however if you want to add new cases, then: For iOS: an iOS device (preferably jailbroken).

We want to get this reflected in the guide. We will be working on topics from basic to advanced Mobile App Security Testing, Reverse Engineering and Tampering on Android and iOS.\nAs a result, the current content will be restructured, which will help\n achieving a more organized testing approach and methodology. detecting potential missing tools or techniques. fixing missing links across chapters.

We want to be able to restructure the MSTG and connect it to the MASVS in a better way during the first 2 days in order to make the chapters more accessible.\nThis session focus on the following topics (and their corresponding chapters from the MSTG):\n Android and iOS Basic Security Testing (0x5b/0x6b) Android and iOS Reverse Engineering and Tampering (0x5c/0x6c) After the first restructuring and updated outline, you\u0026rsquo;ll have the chance to get your hands dirty and craft examples and new content for the MSTG to add next to existing tooling. For the new examples we will be introducing new tools like r2frida. Did you know you can reverse engineer an app straight from the process memory? That means, e.g. for iOS that you may skip the decryption and extraction of the binary.\nThe tickets for this working session will cover these topics and contribute to the restructuring of the MSTG as described in this issue.

A key part of that mission is to educate not just the current generation of developers or information security professionals, but also the next generation, particularly in the context of the acknowledged skills shortage in the security sector.\nA common problem with many security education programmes (whether cyber or InfoSec) or even traditional computer science programmes is that they do not address application security adequately, if at all. In some regions, attempts have been made to address this deficit.\nIn the UK for example, ISC2 and the BCS are working on an initiative to embed security firmly within the Computer Science curriculum, with an emphasis on secure coding techniques. OWASP, through my involvement, also champions this initiative.\nThere is an opportunity for OWASP to pull together its wide-ranging expertise, projects, and dedicated volunteers to engage in these types of education programmes and initiatives by developing an educational strategy for undergraduate and postgraduate students. This could take the form of an open “Standard” curriculum template which can be adopted and adapted by diverse educational partners and organisations. Such a template would also give a useful starting point or reference document for when we engage with other professional bodies.\nWhat The deliverables for this project would be:\n Identify and recommend a number of Application Security Learning Outcomes*1 Link the identified learning objectives to available or required resources Produce an open curricula for industry Outcomes Deliverable #1\nWould be to undertake a gap analysis of existing and missing curricula requirements.\nThis will be achieved through literature reviews, surveys/interviews with industry, information gathering advice from professional bodies.\nThe anticipated generated deliverables would be a number of academic papers in the fields of a) security and/or b) learning and teaching.\nDeliverable #2\nWould be to undertaken a gap analysis of existing and missing teaching resources.*2\nThis will be achieved through a discovery workshop and industry visits.\nThe anticipated generated deliverables would be a number of academic papers and a definitive list submitted to OWASP for new project requirements.\nExample of Available Opensource Resource/LO mapping (what go, what is missing, what needs improving): RESOURCE\tLO#1\tLO#2\tLO#3\tLO#4\tetc…\nVersus\nCheatsheets Webgoat Hackademic Security Shepherd\tJuiceShop\netc\nDeliverable #3\nWould be to develop a learning skills framework suitable for industry, with the approval of OWASP.\nInformation gathering will be achieved via industry outreach and visits to confirm the framework meets industry requirement.\nThe anticipated generated deliverables would be an industry focused academic curriculum conference.\nWho Application Security Trainers CISO\u0026rsquo;s Talent Acquisition Developer Leads Academics Working materials TBD\n",

"content_plain" : "With the widespread adoption of agile development and more organisations looking to organise themselves along the lines of the Spotify Model (Squads, Tribes, Chapters and Guides), how can security functions within those organisations take advantage of Cell Based Structures to be more responsive to the business needs, while incorporating the aptitudes and attitudes of Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners to better meet those needs.\nWHY Many of the issues that businesses suffer with, from business alignment to various forms of inertia, to one size fits all to the perils of outsourcing, are a consequence of how we organize ourselves. Most the time we break companies down into silos grouped around type – i.e. type of activity, practice or data. Hence, we have Finance departments, IT departments and Security departments. Each of these silos consist of many activities, all at different stages of evolution. It is easy for a single department to adopt a one size fits all technique that invariably creates alignment issues with other groups. “We need Security to be more efficient” will be the chant of one group whilst another declares, “We need Security to be more innovative”. The more silos of this type, the more likely that alignment issues will occur. A more effective approach (used by the Next Generation companies) is to break the organization into cells connected by services. The cell-based approach based around grouping components in small teams resolves the problems of one-size fits all and many alignment issues. An example of this can be found with Amazon’s two-pizza model of working in which no team is bigger than can be fed by two pizzas (12 people). Such cell-based approaches are diffusing but are still infrequent in occurrence. The components continue to evolve and as they do so their characteristics change. Which leads to a question. Even if an organization is broken down into small cells, are the right people involved? A two-pizza approach takes advantage of componentization with each group not only providing components to others but also relying on components provided by others. The components continue to evolve and as they do so their characteristics change. Which leads to a question. Even if an organization is broken down into small cells, are the right people involved?\nWhat Cell Based Structures The rules of Cell Based Structures Fitness functions and co-ordination criteria Outcomes Define Security Chapters and the Aptitudes expected Define what is needed to co-ordinate Cell Based Security Organisations Define the Fitness Functions or criteria for security cells Identify the Attitudes of Security professionals across Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners Who The target audience for this Working Session is:\n CISO’s Security professionals DevSecOps Security champions References Squads, Chapters, Tribes and Guides Simon Wardley – On Structure Notes on organisation - Aptitude and Attitude Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners Designing for Constant Evolution ",

"content_plain" : "Most organisations have structures in place that can be used to embed mapping whether it’s an architectural group or an office of the CEO or a business relationship function or some other home. The role of the co-ordination function is to encourage compliance to policy (doctrine) often via a spend control mechanism and to enable sharing between the business units through the use of maps. This doesn’t require some big bang overhaul but usually the formalisation of an existing structure e.g. Office of an executive function or an architectural board can be converted into this role. When spend control is used then a policy limit (e.g. £100K) should be set above which any project must be mapped and the map sent to the co-ordination function. The function can then analyse the map, make recommendations and introduce elements of transparency and challenge within the organisation. As more maps are gathered then the function can also identify patterns for common services.\nWHY It’s through such a function that other forms of doctrine such as cell based structure, use of Pioneer-Settler-Town Planner along with more context specific gameplay can be introduced into the business units. With your shared services group, then you should aim to populate it with small cells of town planners providing industrialised components. Your business units will tend to become dominated by cells of pioneers and settlers providing custom to product and rental services. Your co-ordination function will mainly become settlers focused on ensuring transparency and learning within the organisation itself. It’s really important that if this is your first co-ordination function (in UK Government this was called Spend Control) that it is staffed by people with experience of “future” ways of operating i.e. you want them to challenge the organisation and pioneers can be useful here.\nWhat (\u0026hellip;)\nOutcomes (\u0026hellip;)\nReferences [Wardley Mapping - Chapter 6 - Getting Started Yourself] (https://medium.com/wardleymaps/getting-started-yourself-e1a359b785a2) ",
