Check out https://dsomm.timo-pagel.de/report-samm.php
Questions:
Is the current mapping valid? Some DSOMM activities are not easy to map to SAMM, where should it belong to? (Is it accepted/expected/questioned to have mappings for one DSOMM activity to multiple SAMM activities?) Are the differences of having activities of maturity level 3 in SAMM and in OWASP DSOMM on maturity 1 accepted/expected/questioned?</description></item><item><title>SAMM - Agile guidance</title><link>/tracks/owasp-samm/working-sessions/samm-agile/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracks/owasp-samm/working-sessions/samm-agile/</guid><description>SAMM is conceived as a methodology agnostic model. The specificities for a particular methodology such as Agile are specified in a separate guidance document. In this session, we want to discuss the guidance document for Agile, which has already been developeds. We want to discuss the mapping and suggestions with you to understand where this can further improve.
